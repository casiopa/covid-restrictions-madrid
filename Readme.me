The Community of Madrid is divided in 286 health areas. Right now there are some mobility restrictions in some of this areas based on the accumulated rate incidence (TIA: Tasa de Incidencia Acumulada) for the last 14 days of each area. The criteria for the restricted areas isn’t clear. I wish to obtain a list of the most affected areas in order to TIA rate, and show if they are restricted or not.

I can obtain the information of TIA for each area in json format from the Community of Madrid in this url: https://datos.comunidad.madrid/catalogo/dataset/covid19_tia_zonas_basicas_salud
json url: https://datos.comunidad.madrid/catalogo/dataset/b3d55e40-8263-4c0b-827d-2bb23b5e7bab/resource/907a2df0-2334-4ca7-aed6-0fa199c893ad/download/covid19_tia_zonas_basicas_salud_s.json

But I can’t obtain as structure data the list of restricted areas. This list is announce by Madrid government each week. The official source is this page: https://www.comunidad.madrid/servicios/salud/coronavirus#avisos-interes

I’m thinking on insert restricted areas list manually, at least a couple of weeks to check if there is a match on restricted areas and the areas with a bigger TIA number.
